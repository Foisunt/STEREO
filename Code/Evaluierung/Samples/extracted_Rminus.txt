The recent corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has uniquely challenged medical research community worldwide due to absence of any vaccine or proven therapy
Oncocytic change has been reported in a variety of human tissues and in some epithelial neoplasms and tumors of the kidney, salivary gland and thyroid (Cotton 1990; Hamperl 1936; 1962)
Inclusion criteria: VTs with RBBB morphology ablated from endocardium or epicardium A pseudodelta wave of ≥34 ms has a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 95%; an intrinsicoid deflection time of ≥85 ms, has a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 90%; and an RS complex duration of ≥121 ms has a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 85% in identifying an epicardial VT origin
The common feature of oncocytic tumors is an extreme abundance of mitochondria within the transformed cells that is often associated with increased activity of a number of enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase, DPNH-and TPNH diaphorase (Fischer 1961; Lindsay and Arico 1963; Tandler 1966; Tremblay and Pearse 1959)
Traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) especially traditional herbal medicines, however, find little mention in mainstream discourse of COVID-19 pandemic
General anaesthesia rates stratified by category suggest reductions for categories 2 and 3 Caesarean sections The reduction in general anaesthesia for Caesarean section during the pandemic could also be attributed to staffing changes introduced in our tertiary unit
Additionally, ultrastructural studies of oncocytic tumors have shown that these organelles are often morphologically abnormal (Eble and Hull 1984; Goebel etal. 1980; Tandler 1966)
A comprehensive search of four prominent clinical trial registers ( (8), nivolumab (5), pembrolizumab (1), selinexor (3), bevacizumab (5), acalabrutinib (4),
Since the pandemic began, a 24/7 on-site anaesthetic consultant was established to support on-site anaesthetic trainees
The 4-step algorithm identified the origin in 109 of 115 pace maps (95%), in 21 of 24 VTs (88%) in the study population, and in 19 of 21 VTs (90%) in the validation cohort
A previous national survey of anaesthetic activity in obstetrics (NAP5) revealed that anaesthesia for 23% of category 1 Caesarean section in UK was delivered by trainees out-of-hours with distant supervision possibly contributing to the high "avoidable" general anaesthesia rates 2
Ebner have sometimes been accompanied by mitochondrial malfunction (Capaldi 1988 ) and it has been suggested that mitochondrial proliferation may represent a mechanism to compensate for this mitochondrial deficiency (Fischer 1961; Altmann 1990) , like the physiological response to elevated energy demand (Williams 1986 )
This critical step may affect the outcome of surgical treatment because the most common reason for nonsurgical and surgical endodontic failure is the persistence of intraradicular bacteria and their byproducts 1, 2
We feel that the staffing changes introduced have led to 1) enhanced situational awareness, team working and communication with obstetricians leading to appropriate and timely decision-making for Caesarean section; and 2) improved direct as well as indirect supervision of anaesthetic trainees providing them with more educational and training opportunities to improve both their general anaesthesia as well as their neuraxial anaesthesia techniques and decreased failure rates
This idea is further supported by the observation that myopathies resulting from a mitochondrial disorder are often characterized by increased numbers of these organelles (for review see: Capaldi 1988)
The goal of retrograde instrumentation is to remove the obturation material, infected tissues, and irritants from the root canal system, and create a space that can be properly sealed 3
We feel COVID-19 has given obstetric anaesthetists in our tertiary unit an opportunity to drive down general anaesthesia rates for Caesarean section further, as is evident from our audit
Mitochondrial accumulation requires the expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial encoded proteins (for review see: Attardi and Schatz 1988) although the factors triggering this event are unknown
Anything less undermines the biologic basis for successful endodontic treatment 4
The earliest site of activation was at the apical inferior portion of the left ventricle in 14 patients whose QRS morphology during VT showed a RBBB pattern and left-axis deviation, but at the apical anterosuperior portion of the left ventricle in two patients whose QRS morphology during VT showed an RBBB and right-axis deviation.(1) Idiopathic LV tachycardia has unique electrocardiographic, electrophysiologic, and electropharmacological properties; (2) the electrophysiologic characteristics suggest that the mechanism is reentry; and (3) verapamil is effective in both the shortand long-term treatment of VT
Previous studies have highlighted that general anaesthesia for Caesarean section, with known risks of difficult or failed intubation, aspiration and accidental awareness, is associated with a higher maternal mortality and morbidity (increased blood transfusion, surgical site infection, pain, venous thromboembolism and length of stay) especially when undertaken in an emergency setting. 8, 9 Thus a safe reduction in general anaesthesia rate for Caesarean section (partly caused by COVID-19) is desirable, is in the "best interests of mothers" and is a welcome sign for all personnel in the theatre environment who may feel vulnerable during an aerosol-generating procedure
Thyroid hormone, which has been implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis (Nelson 1987) , is immunologically detectable in less than one-third of oncocytic tissues, even in the thyroid (Schaeffer and Ormanns 1983)
Study type: Observational retrospective Size: 12Inclusion criteria: Patients with normal heart LBBB, inferior axis VT, and previously failed ablation All patients were successfully ablated from the ASOVs
However, this technique has disadvantages including inadequate canal preparation, limited access, and risk of perforation of the palatal wall 5
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused an outbreak in 2003 that killed approximately 800 patients worldwide (1)
The electrocardiographic pattern associated with this VT was LBBB, inferior axis and early precordial transition with Rs or R in V2 or V3
While hypothyroid animals show a decrease in muscle mitochondria (Dudley et al. 1987) , no change in the number of those organelles is observed in the liver in either hypo-, or hyperthroid rats (Jacovcic et al. 1978)
A 3C-like protease from the virus, 3CL pro , is required to cleave 11 sites of the polyproteins pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa) for their maturation (2) . 3CL pro is a chymotrypsin-like protease, but it uses Cys as a nucleophile for catalysis (3)
However, numerous studies have reported an increased incidence of cracks on resected roots after ultrasonic instrumentation [6] [7] [8]
In a comparative study, the ultrastructure and respiratory enzyme activities of several oncocytic tumors of the thyroid have been related to a qualitative and quantitative analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes some essential subunits of the oligomeric complexes of the respiratory chain (for a review see: Attardi and Schatz 1988)
None of the patients had complications, and all remained arrhythmia-free at a mean follow-up of 8 months
Analogous to 3C proteases of picornaviruses, 3CL pro has substrate specificity in cleaving the amide bond between P1-Gln and a small amino acid such as Ser, Ala, or Gly at P1′ (4, 5)
Additionally, a majority of the ultrasonic tips can penetrate to only a depth of 3 mm into the canal
Aim: To describe a series of 8 patients in whom VAs were mapped to one of the rightsided papillary muscles
Only recently, a number of mitochon-drial disorders have been found to result from structural rearrangements or point mutations in mtDNA (Holt et al. 1988 (Holt et al. , 1989 Poulton et al. 1989)
A recent randomized controlled trial evaluating the outcome of endodontic microsurgery revealed a 9 times greater chance of failure if the quality of the root filling was inadequate 9
As evident in its 3-D structure (6, 7) , this small P1′ residue is near Thr25, which likely determines the substrate specificity
Study type: Observational retrospective Size: 8Inclusion criteria: Patients with frequent PVCs or both PVCs and VT who had been referred for catheter ablation and whose arrhythmia was mapped to one of the RV papillary musclesThe QRS complex was broader in the RV PAP group compared with the control group
In two renal oncocytic tumors, a restriction fragment length polymorphism in mtDNA was detected (Kovacs et al. 1989 ) the functional significance of which, however, remains to be substantiated by further studies
Although ultrasonic tips can be as long as 9 mm, they require a larger osteotomy or preparation of a key hole to accommodate the longer tip 10
It was previously demonstrated that the recombinant SARS 3CL pro can undergo auto-processing (7, 8) , which indicates its potential as a tag-cleavage endopeptidase
Patients with an LVEF of 30% or less were at highest risk of sudden death in this early period post-MI (2.3% per month; 95% CI 1.8%-2.8%)
For electron microscopy tissues were fixed in 3.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3
In this study, we replaced the 3CL pro Thr25 with the smaller Gly residue to expand the S1′ site and found that the mutant protease cleaved peptides with larger amino acids such as Met at P1′ with high efficiency
However, the diameter of an ideal osteotomy is recommended to be limited to 4mm 10 , and the removal of healthy facial or buccal bone may result in slower and incomplete healing 11
Each decrease of 5 percentage points in LVEF was associated with a 21% adjusted increase in the risk of sudden death in the first 30 days post-MI
After dehydration, tissues were stained with uranyl acetate in 96% ethanol, and embedded in Araldite (Serva, Heidelberg)
The results presented here demonstrate that Thr25 is essential to determine P1′ substrate specificity and that the T25G mutant can be used as a novel endopeptidase for tag cleavage of recombinant fusion proteins in addition to the commonly used thrombin, Factor Xa (FXa), and tobacco etch virus protease (TEV pro )
Retrograde instrumentation with the use of hand files has been demonstrated, but only in select cases with sufficient bone destruction and access not restricted by anatomical factors 12
The risk of sudden death is highest in the first 30 days after MI among patients with LV dysfunction, heart failure, or both
Moreover, we have constructed two vectors, using prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts, which contained the nucleotides encoding the T25G recognition site AVLQ↓M between the tags and the N-terminal Met of the target proteins
Ultrathin sections were cut with an LKB Ultrotome (Type 8802A) ultramicrotome, stained with lead citrate, and examined in a Zeiss EM10 electron microscope
These rotary files, unlike the traditional NiTi file systems, can be bent and retain their controlled memory 13
In these vectors, PstI (CTGCAG) was chosen as a 5′ cloning site, since its sequence overlapped the nucleotide sequence (GCGGTGCTGCAG) encoding the protease recognition site
In addition, the properties of these files may decrease the risk of some instrumentation errors such as transportation, ledging, or root perforation 14
Identical 5′-PstI/3′-XhoI cloning sites in these vectors were used to allow sticky-end DNA fragments of the target genes generated by PCR (9) to ligate with these vectors simultaneously in a strategy called parallel cloning (10, 11)
Reactions in the presence or absence of inhibitors and control incubations were performed according to Loijda et al. (1976)
The inclusion criteria consisted of: intact teeth with minimal dental caries and/or restorations, absence of a periapical radiolucency, root length of at least 13 mm, and entire root within the maxillae
These vectors, in conjunction with the T25G protease, provide new tools for convenient protein production in different hosts and tag cleavage to yield recombinant proteins with authentic sequences
Aim: (1) To identify typical MRI-derived scar patterns and the associated 12-lead VT morphologies in consecutive patients with NICM who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI and VT ablation; (2) to evaluate its implications for the ablation strategy; and (3) to analyze the value of bipolar and unipolar endocardial voltage mapping to detect the contrast-enhanced MRIderived VT substrate in patients with NICM

Copious irrigation with 3% NaOCl was used throughout and canals were dried with paper points
Rabbit-anti-hamster-UCP-serum was used (1:200 dilution) to detect human UCP
Implantable defibrillators for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in cardiac surgery patients with perioperative ventricular arrhythmias.• Year published: 2014 • PMID: 25146702Aim: To study the potential role of ICDs in patients with VAs <3 months postrevascularization, compare the outcomes between the groups with preversus postoperative arrhythmias, as well as assess the value of clinical markers such as degree of revascularization in predicting the patients at higher risk for the outcomes of total mortality and appropriate ICD therapy
The UPPs-encoding gene (13) was employed as a template for PCR using primers containing the nucleotides encoding the T25G 3CL pro recognition site AVLQ, and the TEV pro recognition site EDLYFQ, respectively
After drying the canals, the teeth were obturated with gutta percha and a resin sealer (2Seal easymiX, Roydent, Johnson City TN)
Total cellular DNA was isolated from tumor tissues or controls according to standard procedures (Ausubel and Frederick 1987)
The PCR products were purified from an agarose gel following electrophoresis and cloned into the pET32Xa/Lic vector (Novagen)
The samples were then stored in 100% humidity for 7 days to allow for complete setting of the sealer
Homogenates were incubated at 37 ~ C in ten volumes of 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCI, 1 mg/ml Proteinase K, and 0.4% SDS until completely lysed
A standardized 4-mm osteotomy was made with a #4 round bur
For expressing EGFP fusion proteins in yeast, primers were used to generate a PCR product that was ligated into pHTPY7, which was modified from pPICZαA Engineering a novel endopeptidase based on SARS 3CL pro A 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) from the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus (SARS-CoV) is required for viral replication, cleaving the replicase polyproteins at 11 sites with the conserved Gln↓(Ser, Ala, Gly) sequences
Next, a 3-mm root resection with as close to a zero-degree bevel as possible was made with a Lindemann bur (Meisinger, Neuss, Germany) ( Figure 1 )
HeLa cell mtDNA was isolated from mitochondria which had been purified by the "two step procedure" of Bogenhagen and Clayton (1974)
In this study, we developed a mutant 3CL pro (T25G) with an expanded S1′ space that demonstrates 43.5-fold better k cat /K m compared with wild-type in cleaving substrates with a larger Met at P1′ and is suitable for tag removal from recombinant fusion proteins
Post-operative radiographs were taken to evaluate the root resection and adjustments were made as necessary (Figure 1 , Left)
Two vectors for expressing fusion proteins with the T25G recognition site (Ala-Val-Leu-Gln↓Met) in Escherichia coli and yeast were constructed
Recombinant plasmid pmt34 containing HeLa cell mtDNA fragment pos. 10254-12878, according to the nomenclature of Anderson et al. (1981) , was generated by PCR amplification (Saiki etal. 1988 ) using 22-mer oligonucleotide primers and a geneAmpR-kit obtained from Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, CT)
In subgroup analyses,LGE was associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in both LVEF ≤35% and LVEF N 35% patients (P <.001 all endpoints), as well as in ICM and NICM
PstI was chosen as a 5′ cloning site because it overlapped the nucleotide sequence encoding the protease site and avoided addition of extra amino acids at the N terminus of recombinant proteins. 3CL pro (T25G) was found to have a 3-fold improvement over TEV pro in tag cleavage at each respective preferred cleavage site
A microsurgical ultrasonic diamond tip (Obtura Spartan, Earth City, MO) was used to make 1-2 mm starting point for the retropreparation
LGE predicted arrhythmic events even in patients with LVEF >30
The amplified mtDNA segment was cloned as a XbaI/ EcoRV-restriction fragment into the bluescript plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif') pAct1, a derivative of pBR322 with a 1250 bp PstI-fragment of hamster actin cDNA, was used to detect the human single copy actin gene (Dodemont et al. 1982)
Substrate specificity and kinetic parameters of the mutant SARS 3CL pro The peptides used as substrates for the T25G protease were synthesized via solid phase, using a 433A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
A new 25/06 and 30/06 VTaper 2H (SS White, Lakewood, NJ) were bent at about 90-degree angle to mimic the clinical and anatomical restrictions ( Figure 2 )
LGE-CMR was present in 1 of 19 (5%) patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and in 4 of 5 (80%) patients with primary cardiomyopathy
DNA probes were labeled with [32P]-dATP (3000 Ci/mmole) using the random primed DNA labeling kit obtained from Boehringer (Mannheim)
Each peptide (100 μM) was incubated with 0.1 μM T25G for 1, 2, and 6 h, and the subsequent mixtures were analyzed by HPLC on a C-18 reverse-phase analytic column
The file was run at a speed of 600 rpm and 440 g-cm on a ProMark Endo Motor (ProMark, Dentsply Tulsa Dental)
Samples (10 lag) of total cellular DNA were digested with PvuIl, separated on an 1% agarose gel and blotted on an Hybond N filter (Amersham, Braunschweig, FRG)
Cleavage products were resolved using a 30-min, 2-90% linear gradient of acetonitrile plus 0.1% TFA
Of the 61 patients in the RVA-2 group, only 6 had a definite diagnosis of ARVD/C according to Task Force Criteria
The file was first advanced to a depth of 10-mm, and if no adverse event occurred, the file was advanced to a depth of 14-mm
Afterwards, the filter was rehybridized to labeled pmt34 mtDNA probe
For K m and k cat measurements, 0.1 μM T25G and 10-200 μM SAVLQ↓MGFRK substrate were used, and the plot of initial rates within 10% substrate consumption versus different substrate concentrations was fitted to the Michaeli-Menten equation using the KaleidaGraph computer program (Synergy Software, Reading, PA, USA)
Post-operative radiographs were taken to have a 2-dimensional evaluation of the retropreparation (Figure 1 , Right)
Design, preparation, and characterization of T25G and T25S 3CL pro Based on the crystal structure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro in complex with a peptide (Protein Data Bank entry 2Q6G; www.rcsb.org/pdb), we have generated a structural model of the protease binding with a modified peptide (Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-Met*-Phe-Arg-Lys), where the Ser at P1′ was changed to Met (indicated by the asterisk)
DNA was quantitated by desitometric scanning of the hybridization signals with an LKB 2222-010 UltroScan XL densitometer
The inclusion criteria were (1) frequent symptomatic VPBs from the RVOT documented by 12-lead ECG to have inferior axis and LBBB QRS morphology; and (2) >6000 VPBs per 24 h on Holter monitoring
After retropreparation, each of the samples was scanned separately using the Micro-CT system (µCT 35; Scanco Medical, Bassersdorf, Switzerland)
We found that Thr25/CG2 of the 3CL pro is within a short distance of 1.32 Å of Met/SD of the peptide (Figure 1 ) as determined by the COOT program (15)
Samples (10 lag) of total cellular DNA were digested with several restriction endonucleases according to the specifications of the manufacturers
The exclusion criteria included (1) the presence of non-RVOT origin for VPBs indicated by an S wave in lead I, an R-wave duration index in V1 and V2 ≥0.5, and an RS wave amplitude index in V1 and V2 ≥0.311; (2) previous AAD therapy; (3) evidence of any SHD; (4) hyperthyroidism or electrolyte disturbance; (5) drug toxicity; (6) diabetes mellitus; (7) blood pressure >165/100 mm Hg; (8) significant impairment of renal function; (9) QT interval >450 ms in the absence of bundle-branch block; and (10) significant atrioventricular conduction disease and LBBB or RBBB
The scan settings were as follows: voxel size of 20 µm, 70 kV, 114 µA
DNA restriction fragments were electrophoretically separated on 0.8% agarose gels, blotted onto Hybond N filters and hybridized to labeled HeLa mtDNA or pint34, respectively
Thus, Thr25 may be replaced by a smaller Gly or Ser (maintaining an -OH group) for better accommodation of Met at P1′
Six of the seven tumors examined revealed a cell morphology very similar to that shown in Fig. 1
Analysis of the percentage of remaining obturation material was calculated using Mimics Innovation Suite (v21, Materialise, Belgium)
To test the above hypothesis, T25G and T25S 3CL pro were expressed in E. coli and purified using NiNTA chromatography
Using threshold and region growing tools, two masks (residual obturation and empty canal) were created at 5-mm and 10-mm from the apex, and their corresponding volumes were calculated
All types of structural aberrations were found within a single tumor, but within an individual cell only one discrete morphological shape of mitochondria was observed (Fig. 1)
In 18 control individuals who had no LV-VT, no P2 potential was recorded within the LSOV
Yields were approximately 20 mg/L medium, which were similar to yields from wild-type preparations
In one of the tumors (no. 7, see Table 1 ), single cells containing only few mitochondria were located amongst the majority of typical mitochondria-rich cells
The percentage of the residual obturation was calculated at each level (5-mm and 10-mm) using this formula: volume of residual obturation/ volume of residual obturation + volume of empty canal ( Figure 3 )
Although the P1 potential might be useful for identifying the successful ablation site, its sensitivity is low
In one case (tumor 8) no increase in the number of mitochondria was found
T25G, with a C-terminal His-tag, was also prepared for removing the protease using NiNTA after tag cleavage
Only the samples in which file separation did not occur (26/30) were subject to micro-CT scans and analysis
The appearance of the P2 potential or an increasingly delayed P2 potential after application of RF energy might be more useful than the P1 potential for predicting successful ablation
Respiratory enzyme activities in tumors and control tissues were graded arbitrarily on a scale of + ( = dye deposition within controls) to + + + (strong staining within tumor cells; see Fig. 2 and Table 1 )
The enzymatic activities of these protease forms were measured using the fluorogenic substrate Dabcyl-KTSAV-LQSGFRKME-Edans, as described previously (12)
Additionally, 2 samples not included due to poor image quality
After mean follow-up of 21.5 ± 11.6 months, all patients were free of sustained VAs, with only 1 patient requiring antiarrhythmic drug therapy and 1 patient having isolated PVCs no longer inducing VF
While most of the tumors consisted exclusively of cells with elevated enzyme levels, some tumors showed highly reactive foci surrounded by cells with normal enzyme activities (nos. 3, 4, 8)
Compared with the activity of wild-type, no significant difference was observed for T25G and C-terminal His-tagged T25G, but T25S showed almost complete loss of activity ( Figure  2A, upper panel)
Ablation was successful in 13 of 16 (81%) patients
In total, 24 samples were scanned and analyzed
One 28-year-old woman patient with normal MRI and no SHD died suddenly 3 months after ablation
However, for the peptide substrate SAVLQ↓MGFRK containing Met at P1′, T25G showed significantly higher specific activity than the wild-type (83.5 μM/min versus 6.8 μM/min) ( Figure  2A Short Technical Report min -1 and the K m of 76.6 ± 3.5 μM for the wild-type, the T25G mutant displayed the k cat of 16.2 ± 0.5 min -1 and the K m of 18.6 ± 2.4 μM (43.5-fold higher k cat /K m ) against the SAVLQ↓MGFRK substrate
In one tumor (no. 7) small areas of histochemically inert cells were interspersed within the majority of cells which showed high activities for all the enzymes tested
Among the 24 scanned specimens, volumetric analysis revealed a median percentage of residual obturation material to be 6.65% (interquartile range of 11.54%) and 28.41% (interquartile range of 28.47%) at 5-mm and 10-mm respectively (Table 1 )
No differences in histochemical enzyme activities were found between oncocytic adenomas and carcinomas (Table 1) . of a particularly high energy demand in oncocytic tumors
Substrate specificity and kinetic parameters of the mutant SARS 3CL pro Next, peptides corresponding to the N-terminal maturation site of SARS 3CL pro with 10 selected variations (Glu, Phe, Gly, His, Lys, Leu, Met, Pro, Ser, and Trp) at P1′ were prepared and used to evaluate the substrate specificity of T25G
One patient with no structural heart disease died suddenly 3 months after ablation
Human UCP is recognized by this antiserum as shown by the signal obtained with the brown fat control tissue (Fig. 3, lane c)
In terms of absolute volume of residual obturation material in mm 3 following the experimental protocol, the median volume and interquartile range at 5-mm was 0.18 mm 3 and 0.36 mm 3 , respectively
As shown in Figure 2B , T25G showed a 12-fold and 8-fold higher activity against the substrates with Met and Leu at P1′, respectively
Median VT frequency was reduced between 6 months preablation and 6 months postablation from 13 to 0
At 10-mm, the median volume was 1.97 mm 3 and the interquartile range was 1.99 mm 3
In contrast, UCP was not detectable in any of the oncocytic tumors tested (Fig. 3, lanes a and b; only two of the five tumors are shown)
The reduction in VT frequency was ≥75% in 82.0%
For the optimal substrate SAVLQ↓SGFRK of the wild-type, T25G mutant showed about equal activity, indicating that T25G still holds the P1′ residue of the small side chain
Among the total 30 specimens, the overall incidence of file separation during retropreparation was 13.33% (4/30)
The result of this examination, together with that of the respiratory enzyme activities and the observed abundance in mitochondria is compiled in Table 1
Major complications in 3.9%: cardiac perforation (1), complete heart block (2), pericardial effusion (3), and death (3)
Similar to the wild-type, T25G did not tolerate peptides with bulky amino acids such as Trp and Phe orcharged amino acids such as Glu and Lys
Only one tumor (no. 8) failed to show an increase in mtDNA
Three of the files separated at the junction of the cutting flutes and shank and one where a 4 mm segment of the file separated ( Figure 4 )
All deaths within 7 days of ablation were preceded by recurrent VT and patients had an LVEF <25%
All 4 file separations (100%) were retrievable
To look for alterations in the mitochondrial genome of oncocytic tumors, restriction enzyme analysis using various restriction endonucleases (listed in the legend of Fig. 4 ) was carried out
The peptide with P1′-Pro showed no activity
One separated at 4 mm, which was irrigated out. (Table 2 )
Fig. 4a , b
After ablation, RBBB developed in 15 patients
Construction of E. coli and yeast vectors to express tag-cleavable fusion proteins by T25G 3CL pro We constructed two vectors for use with E. coli and yeast to express fusion proteins with an AVLQ recognition site to test tag cleavage by T25G
In evaluating the 24 scanned samples, the incidence of crack formation was 0% (0/24) and the incidence of ledge formation was 0% (0/24) ( Table 2 )
DNA was isolated from oncocytic tumors 1, 2, 7 and from thyroid control (Co) and cleaved with BamHI a and ApaI b, respectively
The PstI site CTGCAG, which is part of the AVLQ-encoding sequence GCGGTGCTGCAG, was used as a 5′ cloning site, in conjunction with the 3′ XhoI site, for sticky-end ligation with the PCR product of the target gene (see the strategy illustrated in Figure 3A )
One patient died of HF 9 months after ablation
The restriction patterns of all tumor DNAs proved to be identical with that of controls, and was in line with the expected pattern derived from the standard mtDNA sequence (Anderson et al. 1981)
It is well documented that pathogenic bacteria and their byproducts are the main cause of endodontic failure and persistence of periapical disease 15
As shown in Figure 3B , the purified 5.4 μΜ fusion UPPs (lane 1) was incubated with 0.1 μM wild-type and two mutant 3CL pro (T25G and T25S), and the final products are shown in lanes 2, 3, and 4, respectively
Two patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation at 0.5 and 13 months, respectively, after ablation
The overwhelming consensus is that no instrumentation system or technique can effectively remove all obturation material [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]
A representative example of restriction analysis is given in Fig. 4 , which shows the DNA fragments obtained after digestion of mtDNA with BamHI (1 recognition site) and by ApaI (5 recognition sites) from three tumors (nos. 1-3) and one control sample (Co)
Only T25G mutant efficiently cleaved the fusion protein, yielding tag-free UPPs (28.3 kDa) and the tags (17.6 kDa) as shown in lane 3
One patient had syncope 11 months after ablation, but there was no evidence of VT or heart block in a repeat electrophysiology study
All of these complexes -with the exception of complex II -are composed of subunits which are either encoded by mtDNA or by nuclear genes (Attardi and Schatz 1988)
The inability to completely remove all obturation material provides a potential etiology of future failure because bacteria and biofilm may persist in these untouched areas 21
Under these conditions, the tag cleavage reaction was completed <90 min (data not shown)
This patient died suddenly 29 months after ablation
Altered mtDNA molecules often result from DNAdeletions (Holt et al. 1988 (Holt et al. , 1989 Schon et al. 1989) or duplications (Poulton et al. 1989 ) and have been found together with wild type mtDNA in several mitochondrial disorders (" heteroplasmy ")
With the high success rate of endodontic microsurgery, is there room for improvement? A recent long-term outcome study of endodontic surgery revealed a healing rate of 91.6% at 1year and a 91.4% healed rate at 5-years, respectively
As a control experiment, a UPPs fusion protein with an AAAQ sequence was incubated with the protease, but was not cleaved (data not shown), indicating that T25G specifically recognized the AVLQ cleavage site
The remaining 9 patients were alive and well for a mean follow-up of 19 ± 10 months
Uncoupling by other processes, e.g. by accumulation of certain fatty acids (Luvisetto et al. 1987) , remains possible, however
However, at 10-years this rate dropped significantly to 81.5% 22
Surface ECG before ablation showed LBBB in 10 patients and a narrow QRS in 3 patients
With 0.1 μM T25G, the cleavage of the fusion protein (5.4 μM) was completed <120 min (data not shown)
Only recently it was reported that high cellular levels of mtDNA preceed increased expression of mito-chondrial functions in striated muscle (Williams 1986)
Ablation of the right bundle branch resulted in RBBB on surface ECG in 8 of 9 patients and total AV block with preserved retrograde conduction over the left bundle branch in 1 of 9 patients
Furthermore, von Arx et al 22 reported that maxillary incisors were one of 3 tooth groups that contributed to virtually all failures, with maxillary premolars and mandibular molars being the other tooth groups included in the failures
Comparison of tag cleavage using TEV protease and T25G 3CL pro Since TEV pro is one of the most commonly used endopeptidases for tag cleavage and shares a similar substrate specificity with SARS 3CL pro , we compared the efficiency of tag cleavage using T25G 3CL pro to that of TEV pro against the E. coli-expressed UPPs fusion proteins containing their preferred recognition sites
Major determinants in the regulation of mtDNA replication are the D-loop region of mtDNA, where replication is initiated (Clayton 1982) , and the nuclearly encoded enzymes involved in the replication process
The left bundle branch was successfully ablated in another 4 patients
What could be contributing to these failures? Failure to thoroughly clean and debride the root canal system are the most significant potential reasons for failure following endodontic surgery 23
Compared with TEV pro , T25G showed a 3-fold higher cleavage rate (0.106 μM/min versus 0.035 μM/min; data not shown)
The observation of neighboring cells with mitochondria of different morphology (see Fig. 1 ) may hint at the latter possibility
During mean follow-up of 48 ± 29 months, 3 patients died, but BBR tachycardia did not recur in any patient
The success rate for surgery increases when nonsurgical orthograde retreatment is completed prior to the apical surgery 24
