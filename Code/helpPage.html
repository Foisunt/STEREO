	<h1>Rule Definition</h1>
	<p>
		A regular expression (regex) pattern is used to define rules for the respective rule-set. The syntax is based on the Python library re.
		For additional information see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html</a>.
	</p>
	<h2 id="ruleDef">Important Commands</h2>
	<p>
		Here are some of basic rules, which are often used to define rules in R+ or R-.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>'.' matches any character except newline</li>
		<li>'*' match the expression before, arbitrary often</li>
		<li>'+' match the expression before, at least once</li>
		<li>'?' match the expression before, 0 or 1 times</li>
		<li>'{x}' match the expression before, x times. It is also possible to define a range, e.g. '{2,4}' can match 2, 3 or 4 times.
			Using '?' in combination with this will match as few repetitionen as possible, e.g. '{x,y}?'.</li>
		<li>'^' Matches the start of the string.</li>
		<li>'$' Matches the end of the string.</li>
		<li>'[]' defines set of characters e.g. [abc] or [a-zA-Z]</li>
		<li>'|' concatenates rules in a "or" fashion, careful use, since the new rule is combined with the others by "or"</li>
		<li>'\d' matches any digit from 0-9</li>
		<li>'\w' Matches Unicode word characters; this includes most characters that can be part of a word in any language, as well as<b> numbers </b> and the underscore</li>
		<li>'\s' matches the whitespace character</li>
		<li>'(?#...)' can be used as a comment. The content inside the parentheses will be ignored.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Note: If you want to use one of the characters shown above or generally used by the python library re as a command, use
		the '\' character before it to escape the command.
	</p>
	<h2 id="rPlus">R+ Rules</h2>
    <p>
		R+ rules are defined as named groups with: (?P...). For instance the Rules to extract an apa style t-test is:<br>
		<p></p>
		<i>(?P&lt;t_stat&gt;\(t\(\d+\)\s=\s\-?\d+\.\d+\s,?\sp\s=\s\d\.\d+\))</i><br>
		<p></p>
		the respective sub-rule is:<br>
		<p></p>
		<i>\(t\((?P\d+)\)\s=\s(?P-?\d+\.\d+)\s,?\sp\s=\s(?P\d.\d+)\)</i><br>
		<p></p>
		to extract the taged values. Note that it is important to use the correct syntax for the class name, which is based on the statistic type and located inside the
		&lt;...&gt; tag.
	</p>
	<h3>How to define R+ and sub-rules</h3>
	<p>
		First, the actual R+ rules has to be defined inside the edit field. It is also important to check the 'R+' Radiobutton, 
		otherwise the sub-rule option will be disabled. Once the R+ expression has been defined, make sure to test the expression
		with the test button to see if there are any syntax errors or if its the correct match. To define sub-rules, click on the 
		sub-rules button and open the sub-rules dialog. Within this window, it is possible to add any amount of subrules and also test
		them. To delete/test the sub-rule, click on the respective sub-rule and then click on the button delete/test. It is important
		to create a subrule for every value inside the match, that must be extracted.
	</p>
	<h2 id="acWa">GUI Functions</h2>
	<p>
		The Graphical User Interface does contain different functions, helping in the process of finding the right pattern.
		First of all, with the Radiobuttons 'R+' and 'R-', one can define for which ruleset the new rule has to apply. The default value is
		set to 'R-'. With the 'Test'-Button, the pattern input from the Edit-Field will be test with re.search. If a match could be found,
		a new dialog window will open and show the match, highligthed red. After the 'Test'-Button is clicked and a match has been found
		the 'Add'-Button will be enabled. With the 'Add'-Button, the rule will be safed according to its respective rule set. However, if 
		no clear pattern could be defined, the 'Skip'-Button allows to continue the program, without defining a rule. The 'Apply-Rule'-Button
		will select a fixed amount of randomly selected documents from within the given corpus and will count how many matches could be found among these.
		This might take several seconds.
	</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>
		Pattern, which are marked blue in the text, represent R- matches, which already apply to this text. Hovering over this part will print
		the rule, which was used for this match.
	</p>
	<h2 id="sup">Currently Supported</h2>
	<p>
		Currently supported statistic types:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Student t-test (class name = ttest)</li>
		<li>F-Test (class name = ftest)</li>
		<li>Pearson correlation (class name = cpearson)</li>
		<li>Spearman correlation (class name = cspearman)</li>
		<li>Analysis of Variance ANOVA (class name = anova)</li>
		<li>Mann-Whitney U test (class name = mwutest)</li>
		<li>Wilcoxon signed-ranked test (class name = wsrtest)</li>
		<li>Chi-Square test (class name = cstest)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Use the class name to define R+ rules for the respective statistic type.
