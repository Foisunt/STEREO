There is a positive statistically significant correlation between perceived knowledge and measured basic knowledge (r(95) = 0.283, p = 0.006), but not between perceived knowledge and knowledge about transmission pathways for the virus

The results indicated that although the PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID (114 kDa) fusion gene could be successfully expressed in both stages in the presence or absence of shield1 (Fig. 2b , Additional file 4: Figure S2a) , there was still a significant difference of PfSWIB fusion protein expression between PfSWIB∆ and PfSWIB lines in the trophozoite stage, the expression of PfSWIB fusion protein decreased in PfSWIB∆ line (t (2) = 4.890, P = 0.0394)
In contrast, no significant difference had been found in the ring stage parasite (t (2) = 1.006, P = 0.4205) (Fig. 2b, Additional file 4: Figure S2b)
In the PfSWIB vs PfSWIB∆ comparison, the qPCR data showed a significant linear correlation with the RNA-seq data (r (44) = 0.6281, P < 0.0001)

However, it should be noted that no significant change was detected in the protein expression level of PfSWIB fusion system during the ring stage, either in the presence or absence of drug pressure (t (2) = 1.006, P = 0.4205) (Fig. 2b , Additional file 4: Figure S2 )
